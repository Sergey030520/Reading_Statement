# Reading_Statement
Implementation of the statement reader program.
Implement a program to read information from the payment accounting statement. The statement itself is the following table: 
      first and last name of the person; 
      the amount of money that was paid to the person; 
      payment date in the format DD. MM. YYYY.
Based on the data from the statement, you should calculate the total amount of funds paid and determine the person with the maximum amount of payments.
